		<h3 class="blog">Chatting about the DBC Experience</h3>
			<p>DBC to me represents a most practical educational experience.  When I tell my friends and family about what I'm going to do, I often tell them I'm going to a "civilian tech school."  After intial military training, servicemembers attend short, intensive schools designed to teach them their specific craft or job in the military.  I use this idea to describe DBC because it's a parallel that many of my friends can understand, but the beauty of DBC is it incorportates all the best qualities of this mode of education, while leaving behind the parts that are less desirable.</p>
			<p>I like that personal motivation is so highly valued in the DBC experience, while intelligence is discounted as a measurement of success.  I've never thought of myself as the brightest crayon in the box; as a rather average person I find that I often live in fear of my own failures. Learning anything, especially something so technical in my case, is a process full of stumblings and missteps.  It's only those people who are willing to face the uncomfortablity of failing multiple times that become successful.  We don't often hear about these processes of failure, but that doesn't make them any less real or necessary for anyone who wants to learn a new skill.  What does make a difference is one's willingness to keep moving, to try different approaches and to press through the rather irritating self-doubts that inevitably come along.</p>
			<p>I myself fight all the social nervousness that comes with new experiences, but I find that it's magnified because of having to work on teams.  What if I'm slower than everyone else?  What if I just can't understand?  I have to remind myself there are no grades, you won't get kicked out if you don't understand something within a few hours, and no one will yell at you if you make a mistake. Maybe some of these fears stem from having attended a miltiary technical school, but I think these are variations of the same arguments that many people have with themselves depending on their particular situations.  In this way, I appreciate Shereef talking about the experience in terms of what you put into it, because it allows me personally to answer a lot of these fears with the reminder that I just need to focus on how I love learning about coding, and how that deep interest and desire to learn will motivate me to press forward when I'm having trouble.</p>
			<p>Having a solid circle of people to encourage, teach and mentor you makes all the difference as well.  I like Shereef's analogy of cooking in a kitchen, because I believe it illustrates the most ideal reason for DBC.  You are cooking so that everyone learns to cook, to work well in a kitchen and so at the end you have something good to eat.  I'm excited to go to DBC because I want to learn to code, to work with other coders and to have a marketable skill at the end of my time there.  Working with teachers and other students will inspire me;  I feel like I can only get better when I'm learning from other people.  I'm looking forward to the experience, and I'm excited with what I've already learned thus far.</p>
