			<h2 id="subheader">and talk about Gregorc learning styles</h2>
			<date>Saturday, May 30, 2014</date>
			<p>When I took the test initially, I tied for two styles, Abstract Random and Concrete Random.  So I've compiled the lists below to examine how each affects how I've been learning.</p>
			<h3 class="blog">Abstract Random</h3>
				<p>Abstract Random thinkers prefer:
					<ul>
						<li><span class="bold">Cooperative work:</span> I didn't initally think that I would like working through programming problems with others, but I've seen through several pairings how invaluable it is for me to talk throught things with others.  I like having another person to work with, even if the other person is simply talking me through my own problem-solving process.</li>
						<li><span class="bold">Assignments with room for interpretations: </span>  I think programming is a field that provides for many options and interpretations while working, and I'm excited about that, but sometimes it feels rather overwhelming.</li>
						<li><span class="bold">A balance of social activities and work: </span> I'm a big believer in balance in life, especially when it comes to work and relationships.</li>
						<li><span class="bold">A noncompetitive atmosphere: </span> I'm a rather apathetic competitor in just about every field, so this fits.</li>
						<li><span class="bold">Personalized learning, personal attention and emotional support: </span> Yes, I like all these things, but definetly in moderation.  I also don't mind working alone and asking for help when I need it; sometimes I prefer a chance to figure it out myself for a bit before someone jumps in to help.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
			<h3 class="blog">Concrete Random</h3>
				<p>Concrete Random thinkers prefer:
					<ul>
						<li><span class="bold">Trial and error approach: </span> I feel like that's all I've been utilizing these past few weeks.  I find I'm better at it when I'm fresh and not already frustrated.</li>
						<li><span class="bold">Hands-on experiences: </span> This is for sure my preferred method of learning anything.  I can read and listen all day long, but until I get my hands in it nothing really sticks.</li>
						<li><span class="bold">Brainstorming and open-ended activities: </span> I like brainstorming, because I feel like you can just throw out tons of options, even if then initially don't seem practical.  But when you work in a group, brainstorming tends to lead to some really awesome ideas in my experience.</li>
						<li><span class="bold">Producing real, but creative, products: </span>  I do like to think of creative projects in terms of something tangible and real, and especially like "beautiful" things that are incredibly practical and useful.</li>
						<li><span class="bold">Original and unique approaches to problem solving: </span> I like to think about things from different angles initially, as long as things don't get so caught up in being original that one loses sight of what is practical.  But at least at first, I like to think of many different options for how to get things done.</li>
						<li><span class="bold">Self-directed learning: </span> I've had my fair share of the good and the bad with self-directed learning, and I think that I do value taking charge of your own learning destiny.  I feel like directing your own learning can save you alot of time and money in the long run, because if you are dedicated about learning a skill on your own, you can be selective about the things that you learn to the degree that you are interested in topics, rather than engage in a lot of bureacracy surrounding formalized education.  This appeals to me.</li>
					</ul>

			<h3 class="blog">My Growth Mindset and Internal Pep Talks</h3>
				<p>After a rather rough week, I found myself reminding myself often that these concepts and even better ways of processing information can be learned, and I found this thought comforting after I passed through the sheer anger which assaulted me during the week.  After screaming at my terminal in my head and crying inside because nothing would work, I would mentally calm down by reminding myself that making a wrinkle in my brain is hard work, and if I want it to happen I have to give myself some time and keep on trucking.  I've also had not a few pep talks with myself about how its okay to be fluid with one's self, but maybe a focus on following directions and working sequentially through material might represent a "new technique" for me that could help jump start some problem solving in my head.  I'm recognizing the frustration I've had this week for what it is, which is merely stress related to deadlines and a deep-rooted fear that after all this effort I might be a failure.  On these occassions I tell myself to take a deep breath, say a prayer and step away from the computer, because in reality it will all be okay.  This is the technique that keeps me moving.
