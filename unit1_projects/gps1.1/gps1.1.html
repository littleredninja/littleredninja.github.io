        <h2>Pair programming is good for you!</h2>
        <p>Pair programming is the process of programming with a partner, either in person or remotely.  Working with another programmer provides a myriad of benefits for both people.  Each programmer can benefit from the other's skills, experience and point of view.  It also helps programmers develop their most important skill, which is learning to work well with others.</p>
        <p>Pair programming involves two roles, the driver and the navigator.  The driver is the person who types and takes direction from the navigator.  The navigator verbally provides the driver with code and steers the direction of the project.</p>
