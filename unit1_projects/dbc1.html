		<h4>Ninja Bio</h4>
		<p>Jennie is married to <em>Joey (aka Jose)</em> and has a precious cat named <em>Bailey (aka Boo)</em>.  She prefers to refer to people by nicknames that she has lovingly designated for them.</p>
		<p>Jennie likes to travel, take pictures and sing in the shower.  She also enjoys walking outside and learning to make things.  Her favorite places to live (so far) are Hawaii, Japan and Honduras.</p>
		<p>Jennie's bad habits include eating <strong>too</strong> many cookies or <strong>a whole bag</strong> of chips in one sitting.  She also can mindlessly surf the web for extended periods of time like a time-wasting pro, and thus is full of useless facts, mostly pertaining to internet culture, fringe social groups or random trivia.</p>
