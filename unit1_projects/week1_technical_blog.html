			<p>I can estimate that a good portion of my frittering-away-time on the internet is spent on this addictive site.  With its mesmerizing grid of pretty images and engaging captions representing all manner of blogs, articles and pages, Pinterest is a veritable rabbit hole of idea procurement.  It's also a black hole of a time suck, so don't say I didn't warn you.  A clean neutral color scheme perfectly sets off the myriad of pictures, and an easy-to-reach search button means if you're searching for particular ideas, you can find them quickly and easily, google-style.  And the site's little round logo makes a perfect button for your browser as well.  It's way easier than cutting things out and putting them in your scrapbook.</p>
			<p>I've found that I prefer searching for ideas on Pinterest because of the "first-person" reveiews and comments, even if those comments are not from people that I know.  It's just as enlightening to Pinterest-stalk your friend's boards as it is to Facebook-stalk them, and I've even chosen gifts based on the things that they've pinned.  I'm not above looking to complete strangers for ideas and comments as well, maybe because it's subconsiously comforting to think that I'm following someone's advice rather than just trolling the internet for any old cookie recipe.

			<p>Tumblr is another endless scroll-through website, but I love the simplicity of its blue background and its single string of a random assortment of curated things I'm interested in.  I have a disinterested tendency to use my own tumblr as a collection of things I find noteworthy as opposed to a traditonal blog.  When I feel the need to be inspired, I'll scroll back through my own reposts, which represent an unorganized collection of things that are neat, fun, odd or fascinating.  It gives me the feeling of online shopping and gallery visiting all in one.  </p>
			<p>Tumblr serves as the everyman's blogging platform, and while I myself prefer to use a more powerful platform to format my own blog, I appreciate the accessibility to the world of online journaling that Tumblr offers.  It's a quick and easy site for getting your ideas out there, and in a manner that masters simplicity and beauty.</p>

			<p>I love the power of the internet to connect nerds of all types, and with Photojojo I found my nerdy, camera-loving home.  It's witty copy and whimsical feel is a perfect fit for the fun fun fun content of the site.  The page design is not my favorite, as I'm a little sad that the page is a bit of a maze.  My favorite part of the whole site is their newsletter, which requires a little bit of digging but can be found <a href="http://content.photojojo.com/">here.</a>  These posts have all kinds of fun photo-based art projects, and because they're so awesome, they tend to spark a lot of other great creative ideas.</p>
			<p>The main page is dedicated to the store, which is a dangerous but fun-filled place full of all manner of goodies for lovers of cameras and photography.  Once again, the page's grid structure lends itself to mindlessly scrolling through a treasure trove of camera-based trinkets.  But I love it all the more because Photojojo serves to remind me that I'm not alone in the world, and that there are other equally obsessed camera-nerds out there.  What website is more uplifting than one that gathers all the things you love into one fantastic page?</p>
