			<h3 class="blog">Asking a good question</h3>
				<p>When learning something new, it's inevitable that you'll run into something you don't understand. The beauty of the internet is that we can search billions of resources and connect with people all over the world to find the answer. But just how do we tap into that vast power effectively? It boils down to how we ask our question.</p>
			<h3 class="blog">Tips and tricks</h3>
				<p><span class="bold">Take your time. </span>Writing a good question takes a hot minute, so don't just shoot off your question and expect the world to come back with the answer you need. Think about how to phrase your question carefully. Be specific and consider how you can word the question.  Creating a question title that makes sense is extremely important. Think about the fact that you've already googled this question - what did you search for? Consider all the people who will come after you, looking for the same information. Be kind and label the question accordingly.</p>
				<p><span class="bold">Research. </span> Obviously you've already used  <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/" target="blank">the Google</a> to check up on your question, so it might be helpful to list the resources you've used and state why these resources didn't answer your question. </p>	
				<p><span class="bold">Explain your process. </span> How did you arrive at your problem, and what did you expect that didn't come to pass? Explaining how you got to your original answer will let others teach you about processes, thus helping you even more.</p>
				<p><span class="bold">Add your code. </span> If your question is specific to a bit of code, include the code. But this comes with a caveat. Don't include unneccesary or unformatted code. This will not do.  People reading questions have an attention span of 3 seconds, and if your question has extraneous information, you're like to enrage the very people you are turning to for help. Don't do it.</p>
				<p><span class="bold">Edit. </span> Finally, look over your question. Is everything spelled correctly? Is everything formatted properly? Does your question even make sense? If you were looking at your question for the first time and had no idea what you were working on, would you be able to answer it (if you knew the answer?) Okay, that last one might be tough, but the bottom line is make sure you read and edit the question.</p><p>All these things will help you get the answer you're looking for, help those who are answering your question determine what you need, and help thos who are also looking for that information find it readily.  In this way, you are saving the planet when you ask good questions!  Keep up the good work!</p>
