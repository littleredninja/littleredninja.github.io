			<p>Regular expressions, abbreviated to REGEX or REGEXP, is special text used to search for patterns.  A simple example would be using a wildcard like *.txt to search for all text files, only REGEX is more powerful and can be used to search for more complex patterns.</p>
			<p>While it often looks like a confusing string of characters, REGEX is actually made of simple codes to represent different patterns.  They can be strung together and used to search for a wide variety of characters and even spaces.REGEX can help simplify code, and often several lines of code can be condensed to just one with a simple REGEX.</p>
			<h3 class="blog">Getting started</h3>
				<p>REGEX expressions in Ruby begin and end with a / character.  A very basic REGEX expression can search for a particular character.  Simply place your character between the forward slashes and you'll have a REGEX!</p>
				<p><span class="regex">/A/</span> for example, will search for a capital A.<p>
				<p><span class="regex">/a/</span> for example, will search for a lower-case a.<p>
			<h3 class="blog">Other searches</h3>
				<p>You can also search for variations, which can be useful when dealing with hard-to-predict user input.</p>
				<p><span class="regex">/gr[ea]y/</span> for example, will search for either grey or gray.<p>
				<p>A dot works much like a star in a wildcard search, and will match any character except a line break character.  For example, <span class="regex">/gr.y/</span> will also return grey or gray, but will also return gr%y, so it's best used sparingly.</p>
			<h3 class="blog">Possibilities</h3>
				<p>Not only can you match specific characters, but you can match words, spaces, digits and more.</p>
				<p><span class="regex">/\w/</span> will match any word.
				<p><span class="regex">/\d/</span> will match any single digit.
				<p><span class="regex">/\s/</span> will match any space.
				<p>There is a vast library of possibilities for matching.  With so many options, the best way to find as many as possible is to play around and experiment with them!</p>
