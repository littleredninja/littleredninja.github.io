			<h3 class="blog">Conflict</h3>
				<p>The last time I can recall a conflict is one I had at work, which came about because I was complaining about having to jump through hoops to perform a task that basically meant "babysitting" a bunch of grown folks who should have been able to manage their own affairs.</p>
				<p>My supervisor asked me to take care of the task, and I wanted to stress that it was really not my job. I got a little emotional, and as a consequence, my supervisor did too.</p>
				<p>Afterwards, I regretted the way I acted because I felt that I should have been more collected when conveying my concerns. I hadn't felt like I was overly emotional, but apparently my tone said that I was.  Despite how I was feeling, I really hated the idea that my frustration had spread to my supervisor, causing her to act in a way that was uncharacteristicly emotional. I let myself cool down, and was able to work with her the rest of the day without issue.</p>	
				<p>I don't know if my actions following made things better, as I never apologized or even addressed the issue again, but I realized that everything I was complaining about was a non-issue; I couldn't have changed what needed to be done, and in reality it wasn't a difficult task to begin with. I was just grumpy that it fell to me.</p>
				<p>In the end, I realized that I myself was the source of the conflict, and that realization made me very uncomfortable. I am extremely non-confrontational by nature, and so realizing that I had brought about a conflict through my own grumpiness made me sad and embarassed. If I could go back, I would have avoided the whole situation by addressing my supervisor (who incidently is a friend as well) with more respect and tact.</p>
				<p>This experience taught me to notice when I am acting in a way that is spreading anger and making people upset. I also learned I need to pay attention to how I respond when I'm frustrated with a situation. The last thing I want is to spread negative energy in a working enviroment, especially over trivial things. If I find myself getting frustrated with a situation, I try to take a step back, give myself a moment, and continue on when I'm more focused and calm.</p>
