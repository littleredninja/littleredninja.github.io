			<h3 class="blog">Pairing is Caring</h3>
				<p>When I first read through the Phase 0 handbook, I think the part that stressed me out the most was the idea of pairing.  Pairing is simply the act of working together with another coder, and while this can seem fairly straightforward, there were a several things that stressed me out about the idea of pairing, especially with strangers.</p>
				<p>Having my own personal in-house pair in the form of my fellow boot and husband Joey is rather convenient, but I have to say that frequently I'm not too particular about how I present myself to him.  He endures the brutal task of helping me understand quite well, and I am a better coder for his tutelage.</p>	
				<p>While it's one thing to pair with a person you're comfortable with, it's quite another to pair with a stranger.  My inital impressions of a pair session was that I would be at a loss for any ideas, and therefore somewhat useless in contributing to any solution.  My lack of knowledge would enfuriate my fellow coder, and I would walk away from the session further confused about how to code.</p>
				<p>The acutal experiences have turned out differently, and unexpectedly were fun.  I found out that I enjoy talking through soultions with another person, and actually got so caught up in working that I wanted to drive and navigate and lean back and watch all at the same time.  My pairs have always taught me something new, or better explained things I didn't quite understand.  In talking to them, I was forced to explain things I knew, thus helping me know them better as well.</p>	
				<p>I also encountered a problem I didn't anticipate, and that was trouble with conveying my ideas using coding vocabulary.  I've found times where I wanted to share an idea, but I found myself unable to express clearly what tools I wanted to use or what steps we should take.  Without the proper vocabulary my ideas floundered in the air while I struggled to constuct sentences with terms I barely understand, confusing my pair and generally mucking up the process of coding.  I hate that.  I know in time a familiary with the language of coding will come, but in the meantime I'll work on learning how to talk in code real good.</p>
				<p>But each pairing experience demonstrates to me that coding is about more than punching keys.  It's about solving problems efficiently, learning as you go and working with other people to make stuff happen.  Pairing helps you with all those things, and while it can be initially uncomfortable to work with someone new, it's been said that two heads are better than one, and I tend to agree.</p>
			<h3 class="blog">The effects of the Feed Bacon-ator</h3>
				<p>I call our feedback forum the Feed Bacon-ator, because I would rather eat bacon than give feedback.  I appreciate the process of providing our pairs feedback, and I even appreciate the forum as a whole;  the crowdsourcing of monitoring feedback is a neat idea and I believe effective.  Maintaining an enviroment of respect and encouragement is important, and I think the feedbackinator contributes to that process as best it can.</p>
				<p>However, I often find it difficult to leave specific, actionable and kind as is mandated by DBC Feedback guidelines.  I have no trouble relating kindness to my pairs as all of them have had loads of ideas, knowledge and enthusiam to contribute to my pairing sessions.  How can they improve?  I don't yet have anything to say that we all haven't already heard - keep studying, keep pressing, keep up the hard work.  These generic tips hardly seem specific enough, and probably don't really qualify as actionable either.  I value feedback because I believe honest feedback is essential to improvement;  I'm just not sure yet how to best provide this for my peers, as I don't yet feel qualified regarding how best to improve any processes for coding.</p>
				<p>More valuable to me is the feedback provided by the instructors, who often provide resources and tips on where to look or dive in further to the material.  I find that often the GPS facilitators as well as my pairs provide other resources that have pulled me through difficult material to understand.  Sharing is caring is pairing, and without fail every time I work with someone I learn something new.</p>
