				<p>When I first read through the Phase 0 handbook, I think that stressed me out the most was the idea of pairing.  Pairing is simply the act of working together with another coder, and while this can seem fairly straightforward, there were a several things that stressed me out about the idea of pairing, especially with strangers.</p>
				<p>Having my own personal in-house pair in the form of my fellow boot and husband Joey is rather convenient, but I have to say that frequently I'm not too particular about how I present myself to him.  He endures the brutal task of helping me understand quite well, and I am a better coder for his tutelage.</p>	
				<p>It's one thing to pair with a person you're comfortable with, while it's quite another to pair with a stranger.  My inital impressions of a pair session was that I would be at a loss for any ideas, and therefore somewhat useless in contributing to any solution.  My lack of knowledge would enfuriate my fellow coder, and I would walk away from the session further confused about how to code.</p>
				<p>The acutal experiences have turned out differently, and unexpectedly were fun.  I found out that I enjoy talking through soultions with another person, and actually got so caught up in working that I wanted to drive and navigate and lean back and watch all at the same time.  My pairs have always taught me something new, or explained better things I didn't quite understand.  In talking to them, I was forced to explain things I knew, thus helping me know them better.</p>	
				<p>I also encountered a problem I didn't anticipate, and that was trouble with conveying my ideas using coding vocabulary.  As a constant student of communication, I thought that part of the process woundn't be difficult.  But I've found times where I wanted to share an idea, but I found myself unable to express clearly what tools I wanted to use or what steps we should take.  Without the proper vocabulary my ideas floundered in the air while I struggled to constuct sentences with terms I barely understand, confusing my pair and generally mucking up the process of coding.  I hate that.  I know in time a familiary with the language of coding will come, but in the meantime I'll work on learning how to talk in code real good.</p>
				<p>But each pairing experience demonstrates to me that coding is about more than punching keys.  It's about solving problems efficiently, learning as you go and working with other people to make stuff happen.  Pairing helps you with all those things, and while it can be initially uncomfortable to work with someone new, it's been said that two heads are better than one, and I tend to agree.</p>
