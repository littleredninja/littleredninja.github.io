			<h3 class="blog">Values</h3>
				<p>What values do I most value?  I value in my life the opportunity to live with adventure, creativity, faith, family and friends, free time, integrity, volunteering with other and having peace in my heart.</p>
				<p>I chose these values because anytime in my life when I've been truly happy, these are the values that have been at play.  Of these, my favorite is probably adventure.  I like to think of every experience as an opportunity to live an adventure;  One of my favorite things is to try things I've never tried and to go places I've never been.</p>
				<p>I've tried to be very deliberate about the things that I do, because througout the years I've recognized for every opportunity you want to pursue, you give up valuable time and energy.  This means that choosing to do one thing will take away from your opportunity to pursue another interest, and I don't want to look back and feel like I've wasted my time.  Saying yes to Dev Bootcamp means saying no to continuing a career I've enjoyed, or traveling, or pursuing a higher degree.  These no's are not permanent, but they signify my devotion to pursuing a new skill, because those goals are temporarily set aside in the name of grasping at something new and relatively unknown.</p>	
				<p>The last thing someone asked my advice on was either how to phrase something, as in my former life I was an writer.  Or it might have been how to make something, as I'm a little craft-obsessed.  Or it might have been about marriage, because as a missionary I end up dispensing a lot of advice about that as well.  I can't say that I'm an expert at any of those things, but I've because I love all those things I don't mind sharing what I've learned about them through the years.</p>
				<p>Eventually, I hope to offer the same sort of advice about coding.  After consistently improving my skills and learning as I go, I would like to be able to share and encourage other people in their coding endeavors.  My dream would be to combine all the values that I love into a life spent helping others and chasing a great adventure. I believe coding is a skill that can make this dream happen.  This is the idea that cheers me when I become discouraged, and one that motivates me to keep on.</p>
