			<p>Classes are objects in Ruby that provide a template for other objects.  Creating classes allows us to group objects and methods, and provides a way for us to create objects quickly and with pre-defined properties, saving us a few steps when we want to make several objects with the same traits.</p>
			<h3 class="blog">Creating Classes</h3>
				<p>Creating classes is fun and easy!  Pick a topic, any topic, and we'll make it a class.  We'll start with something I like; cats.</p>
				<p class="code">class Cat(name, size, color, fav_food)
				<br>&nbsp;def initalize
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;@name = name
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;@size = size
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;@color = color
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;@fav_food = fav_food
				<br>&nbsp;end
				<br>end</p>
				<p>Here we create a class of Cat, where each cat has a name, size, color and favorite food.  Every time we create a new cat, the cat will have these traits.  To make a new cat, all we need now is the following:</p>
				<p class="code">bailey = Cat.new(Bailey, fat, orange, fish)</p>
				<p>Now we can make our cats do things with methods inside our class.  Let's say we want the cat to meow, so we can make a method.</p>
				<p class="code">class Cat
				<br>&nbsp;def meow
				<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;puts "#{@name} says meow!"
				<br>&nbsp;end
				<br>end</p>
				<p>If you'd like to call the method, just call bailey.meow and Bailey will meow!</p>
			<h3 class="blog">Instance Variables</h3>
				<p>The @ symbol denotes an instance variable, which is a variable that is accessible for every instance of Cat, but not outside those instances.  To find out Bailey's size, color or favorite food, we simply need to call Bailey.fav_food and we find out that he likes fish.</p>
