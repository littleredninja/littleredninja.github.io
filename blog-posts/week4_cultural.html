			<h3 class="blog">Internet Identity</h3>
				<p>The internet is a magical place where we can learn about any subject we want, connect with people from around the world and reach beyond the bounds of our physical space to explore, learn about and meet the best of humanity.  It also offers us the opportunity to present ourselves in any light that we might choose, and to reinvent our lives without the discipline and fortitude it normally takes to change into the best versions of ourselves.</p>
				<p>This disconnect between who we are and who we say we are online presents interesting issues for social interactions in this modern age, and affects not only the tech industry but the entire history of civilization.</p>
			<h3 class="blog">Satisfaction</h3>
				<p>The phenomenon of social media has given rise to a myriad of trends in the ways we use these outlets to communicate and interact with friends and strangers.  While I love Facebook-stalking friends from high school, I also resent how wrapped up in scrolling through statuses I can get.  There have been all kinds of articles about how Facebook makes you <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140206-is-facebook-bad-for-you" target="_blank">sad</a> and <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2013/09/the-real-reason-facebook-makes-us-unhappy.html" target="_blank">lonely</a>, how it can foster our own sense of inadequecy and produce in us unwarrented envy of the seemingly awesome lives our friends live.  But do our best picture-worthy moments and carefully curated statuses accurately represent our lives?  Moreover, are they worth the effort and thought we put into them?</p>
			<h3 class="blog">Conversation</h3>
				<p>In addition, interaction and conversation on the internet has changed the way we communicate.  We've come up with an entire new vocabulary for the way we navigate the web, and most of us can't possibly picture a time when dictionaries  <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/new-words/2014-update.htm" target="_blank">didn't include the word "website".</a>  We see <a href="http://psychcentral.com/news/2012/07/29/texting-may-undermine-language-spelling-skills/42309.html" target="_blank">spelling and writing abilities</a> of the general population decline, and due to the vast reserves of knowledge at our fingertips, our own brains need not remember as much, and so <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2015117/Google-stupid-How-search-engine-rewired-memory-leave-forgetful.html" target="_blank">they don't.</a></p>
				<p>A more alarming change is the way rules of decent address fly out the window when we converse on the internet.  The gammit from comments with poor spelling and abhorent grammer to unprovoked <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/10/30/twitter_death_threats_are_meaningless_you_should_ignore_them.html" target="_blank">death threats</a> are ubiqutous on everything from controversial news stories to randomly uploaded home videos.  While we cultivate our own social profiles, web anonimity lends itself to revealing the darkest and most <a href="http://www.thewire.com/technology/2012/11/welcome-twisted-age-twitter-death-threat/59354/" target="_blank">cowardly</a> corners of humanity where because commenters feel so far from the actual person so as to be able to say anything they want no matter the impact on the person addressed.</p>
			<h3 class="blog">Downright Deception</h3>
				<p>But those carelessly left comments can translate into the most personal attacks when we read them from our end of the screen.  Cyberbullying is a term we've all heard and detest.  Other more unusual acts of deception online can cut people to the core.  One of my favorite recently coined technology terms is catfish, based on the <a href="http://www.iamrogue.com/catfish" target="_blank">MTV-produced documentary</a> about a young man who falls for a girl online, only to realize she's not who she says she is.  His story is just a sample of the many people who interact with false internet personas daily.  This <a href="http://www.academia.edu/2285135/The_Real_Problem_Avatars_User_Identity_and_Online_Social_Interaction_Krakow_PL_" target="_blank">personality experimentation</a> is the benign end of the spectrum; at the other end are scammers and criminals willing to decieve for the primary objective of robbing one's bank account through manipulation a victim's time, energy and love.  I believe we open ourselves up to this kind of deception when we are willing to invest more time and energy in our online lives than in our lives in the real world.</p>
			<h3 class="blog">Solution</h3>
				<p>I love the internet because of all the good it can do.  But I also recognize that nothing can replace the time you spend away from your computer.  Building relationships, engaging with other members of the human race face to face, even stepping outside in the sunshine is worth more than all the cat videos in the world.  So what's the solution?  Step away from the computer.  Look up from the phone.  Live the life in front of you occassionally, because at the end of your life, I can guarentee you won't wish you had spent more time on Facebook.</p>
