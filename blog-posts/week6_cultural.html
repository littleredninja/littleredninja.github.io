			<h3 class="blog">Stereotype Threat</h3>
				<p>Stereotype threat is defined by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_threat" target="blank">Wikipedia</a> as the experience of anxiety in a situation in which a person has the potential to confirm a negative stereotype about his or her social group.  This anxiety can lead to diminished or inefficient performance during evaluations or tests.</p>
				<p>Studies by social physcologists have shown that in educational situations where students are made aware of efforts to counter bias, minority students tend to perform better and more equally to other student groups.  I find this interesting on the level that it demonstrates attitude as a very powerful tool, one with the power to affect how one performs in real life.  We are all very aware of the things that are expected of us, and apparently how we handle that expectation internally impacts our work.</p>
				<p>For those who suffer from the anxiety attached to their own experiences of stereotypes, I encourage you to battle those any way you can.  This is an instance where an understanding of growth mindset particularly helps.  Reminding oneself that you really can learn anything if you put your mind to it can help you past some of the expectations that lead you to lose confidence in yourself.  I found it particularly interesting that the phenomenon of stereotype threat is more prevelant in <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/08/thin-ice-stereotype-threat-and-black-college-students/304663/3/" target="blank">high-achieving populations</a>, because it means that stereotype threat is generally associated with people who are highly motivated to succeed.</p>	
				<p>I also think a relentless pursuit of things that interest you can help with overcoming a fear of fulfilling stereotypes as well as doubts within your own mind.  When I was in college, I transferred to a fine arts program despite a lack of much formal art training prior to college.  Art tends to be a subject where most people think talent is inherent, and I did not consider myself a particularly good artist.  But I had a deep love for making art and believed I could learn to do it well.  It turns out artistic principles and skills, like any other skill, can be learned through patience and practice.</p>
				<p>To be clear, I'm not an awesome illustrator or painter, but being a student at art school means enduring the humiliation of discussing your painting work in front of a class full of exceptionally talented painting majors.  I think being able to endure the uncomfortablility of dealing with others scrutiny of your work is important.  Were my paintings horrible?  Of course.  Did I have to listen to everyone tell me they were horrible?  To a degree, as people were honest, but kind.  This honesty I valued more than anything, and it is a mark of trust among a community.  And what was the effect of these critiques?  I am a better artist for them, and later I went on to take other painting courses to improve myself and because I enjoy doing it, not merely to say that I am an awesome painter.  After college, I applied these same principles to learning a wide variety of skills, from painting to learning languages to martial arts.</p>
				<p>What does this have to do with stereotype threat?  I think these are all exercises preparing us for the mental battle that we need to fight when we're learning something new.  Why can't I understand this?  Why am I performing so poorly?  Or why do I give such horrible job interviews?  Just recognizing how our own anxiety affects us can help us battle it, whether it comes from a fear of fullfilling a stereotype we fall under, or whether its a fear of our own inadequecy.</p>
				<p>I beleive that these battles are also better fought within an enviroment of trust.  A community of people that encourages each other and recognizes that everyone has something to contribute to the whole is invaluable.  The ideal community does not insulate us from criticism, but instead drives us to be better because there is an understanding that everyone can be better.  This type of communal encouragement fosters growth, and changes the world around us.  Ultimately I think this is how we break stereotypes, by proving with our actions and with our community enviroment that they are not real at all.</p>
