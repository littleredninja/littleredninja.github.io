			<h3 class="blog">Javascript Love</h3>
				<p>After reseraching some opinions on JavaScript, I find that through the past few years the language has had its ups and downs among programmers. I found people who hated it, then switched camps to say it really wasn't all that bad.  But JavaScript seems to have trumped naysayers as evidenced by it's popularity;  despite a rocky start as a bulky, amatuer language, it has developed a reputation for awesomeness because of its ability to deliver interactive web content with little weight.  Other developers praise its flexibility, its ubiquity and how the core concepts of JavaScript translate easily into other programming languages.  Many JavaScript enthusiasts laud the use of JavaScript with other tools, including jQuery, Node and HTML5.</p>
				<p>I came across this pretty nifty film in my research, build with HTML5 and JavaScript.  The combo seems pretty awesome and powerful to me.  Check it out here: <a href="http://www.jacktorrancetrip.com/" target="_blank">The Trip</a></p>
			<h3 class="blog">Javascript Hate</h3>
				<p>So I've read some complaints that 	JavaScript is sort of ugly and complicated.  From my limited experience with Javascript and Ruby, I do have to say I prefer Ruby.  Ruby to me is more readable and intuitive, but this is coming from a person who doesn't really know much about either so take that for what it's worth.  I myself had a pretty rough week programming in JavaScript, as I found it pretty easy to make syntax mistakes and forget rather important details when typing.  But generally I would agree that it is a pretty easily language to learn the basics of quickly, and I'm interested to dive in more.</p>
